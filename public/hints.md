***Don't be lazy dear friend , try and solve the task yourself ! ðŸ˜‡ ***

# If the task seem hard to you , then let me give a hint to you.

- Remember , atoms are the building blocks of your universe , and the selectors help you cluster and shape your universe !

- First of all check your atoms , they need to hold two parameters - key and default ! 
    -   Keys are usually a string
    -   And default could be just about anything

## It's hard to shape a whole universe i know , lemme help you further in this noble role !

- Go to your selecters and see , if there is something fishy
